# TheorMech_Inno_2024
The Theoretical Mechanics course for 2nd year bachelor students in Innopolis University, spring semester.

# How to use

This repository contains regularly updated course materials. You can use lab slides for self study. They are created in such manner, that almost 90% of material can be understood  without teacher.

Pull requests with suggestions and improvements, however small or big, are welcome!

The changes in lecture slides are going through an automated check.

The PDFs are compiled and updated automatically when PR is merged. You don't need to update them manually. They are also uploaded as workflow artifacts for every new commit pushed into this repository. You can use them to see your changes.
 
Consider adding \*.pdf to the .git/info/exclude file on your local repo. Here is the ~~overy long but helpful~~ [description why it works](https://medium.com/@dave_lunny/exclude-files-from-git-without-committing-changes-to-gitignore-986fa712e78d)
